When we establish a reverse shell, it is often very limited in functionality and prone to breaking. 

Basic features like command history navigation (using up/down arrows) or autocomplete may not work. To resolve these limitations, we can upgrade our TTY using the `python` or `stty` method. 

Below is a step-by-step guide on how to do this.

**1. Spawn a TTY Shell**  
Run this in the reverse shell:

```shell-session
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

**2. Adjust Terminal Settings**

- Suspend the shell: `Ctrl+Z`
- In your local terminal, run:
    
    ```shell-session
    stty raw -echo  
    fg  
    [Press Enter Twice]  
    ```
    

**3. Fix Terminal Size (Optional)**

- In a local terminal:
    ```shell-session
    echo $TERM          # e.g., xterm-256color  
    stty size           # e.g., 38 116  
    ```

- Back in the reverse shell, set:
    ```shell-session
    export TERM=xterm-256color  
    stty rows 38 columns 116  
    ```


You now have a fully interactive TTY shell with command history, autocomplete, and full terminal features.
